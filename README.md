# Scripts_for_RNA_assembly
Here I am saving the script that I used during my RNA-seq analysis. This include quality check, trimming of raw RNA seq data, assembly by using trinity and busco check of assemble transcriptome.
I used 25 plant sample for RNA-seq data generation. As we do not have ge of C. x powellii, we performed de-novo transcriptome assembly to generate reference genome. We used this reference genome 
in our research and result of this analysis is summarized as scitific article " Auxin and light-mediated regulation of growth, morphogenesis, and alkaloid biosynthesis in Crinum x powellii ‘Album’ 
callus" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2023.113883.
