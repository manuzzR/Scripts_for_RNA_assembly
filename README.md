# Scripts_for_RNA_assembly
Here, I am saving the script that I used during my RNA-seq analysis. This includes quality checks, trimming of raw RNA seq data, and assembly by using trinity and Busco checks of the assembled transcriptome.
I used 25 plant samples for RNA-seq data generation. As we do not have genomic data of C. x powellii, we performed de-novo transcriptome assembly to generate a reference genome. We used this reference genome 
our research and the result of this analysis are summarized in scientific article " Auxin and light-mediated regulation of growth, morphogenesis, and alkaloid biosynthesis in Crinum x powellii ‘Album’ 
callus" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2023.113883.
